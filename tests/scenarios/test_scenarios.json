Secondary users: Patients booking appointments. The problem we solve: Current scheduling is fragmented across locations, leading to double-bookings, long wait times, and provider burnout. Existing solutions like Zocdoc are patient-facing and don't help with internal scheduling optimization. Our solution: AI-powered scheduling that considers provider preferences, travel time between locations, equipment availability, patient history, and insurance verification. Key features: 1) Smart scheduling that maximizes provider utilization while minimizing patient wait times, 2) Automated insurance verification before appointments, 3) No-show prediction with automated reminders, 4) Cross-location resource sharing, 5) Integration with major EHR systems (Epic, Cerner, Athena). Revenue model: $500/month base + $50/provider/month. Implementation: White-glove onboarding with data migration from existing systems. Target market size: 250,000 medical practices in the US with 5+ providers. Competition: Zocdoc (patient-facing), Calendly (too simple), custom EHR scheduling (poor UX). Our advantage: Purpose-built for multi-location complexity with AI optimization. Team: CEO with 10 years healthcare IT, CTO from Google Calendar team, CMO former Zocdoc. Current status: MVP built, 3 pilot customers, $50K MRR. Seeking: Validation of scalability assumptions and go-to-market strategy.",
