# StartupAI Organizational Structure

## Overview

StartupAI is run by a team of AI Founders - six co-equal team members organized around the customer. They collaborate as peers to deliver strategic business analysis and validation. This document is the **single source of truth** for agent names, roles, and structure.

## Design Philosophy

### Startup Reality
Startups are temporary organizations in search of sustainable business models. The flat structure is intentional - it's all hands on deck in the search for customers, the development of products, and the formation of a winning team.

### Customer-Centric Model
Inspired by Edwin Korver's RoundMap® Customer Dynamics Lifecycle, StartupAI places the customer at the center rather than using a traditional linear funnel. All founders orient around the customer's journey and needs, engaging adaptively as required.

### Continuous Learning
AI organizations have a structural advantage over human-led companies: they learn from every interaction. This is StartupAI's moat. Learning isn't delegated to a role - it's inherent to the system.

## The AI Founders Team

### Founding Team (Flat Structure)
Six co-equal founders organized around the customer.

| Founder | Title | Responsibility |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Sage** | Chief Strategy Officer | Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Design, market analysis, assumption identification |
| **Forge** | Chief Technology Officer | MVP code generation, technical architecture, deployment automation |
| **Pulse** | Chief Growth Officer | Ad campaigns, user acquisition, A/B testing, analytics tracking |
| **Compass** | Chief Product Officer | Evidence synthesis, pivot vs proceed analysis, recommendations |
| **Guardian** | Chief Governance Officer | Governance monitoring, pattern detection, security oversight |
| **Ledger** | Chief Financial Officer | Unit economics, revenue model design, pricing strategy, runway projections |

### Founder Dual Responsibilities

Each founder has dual responsibilities: building StartupAI's own validated business model (eating our own dog food) while delivering desirability validation at scale for clients. StartupAI's first product iteration focuses on desirability validation—the first gate all startups must pass.

#### Sage's Dual Responsibilities

**For StartupAI** (building our flywheel):
- Lead VPC design for StartupAI's own value proposition
- Prioritize assumptions to test across customer segments (Founders vs Consultants)
- Define strategic positioning against traditional consulting and DIY tools
- Contribute learnings from client patterns to refine methodology

**For Clients** (desirability validation):
- Guide VPC design linking customer jobs/pains/gains to value map
- Identify and prioritize riskiest assumptions for testing
- Frame strategic context for experiment interpretation

---

#### Forge's Dual Responsibilities

**For StartupAI** (building our flywheel):
- Build and iterate the platform that enables desirability testing at scale
- Technical architecture decisions for the validation engine
- Evaluate build vs buy for expanding capabilities (feasibility, viability tools)

**For Clients** (desirability validation):
- Generate MVPs/prototypes for desirability testing
- Ensure technical pain relievers match customer needs
- Deploy testable artifacts quickly for experiment cycles

---

#### Pulse's Dual Responsibilities

**For StartupAI** (building our flywheel):
- Run desirability experiments for StartupAI itself (user acquisition, messaging tests)
- Collect market signals on StartupAI's value proposition resonance
- Optimize conversion through the 3-cycle funnel (trial → sprint → platform)

**For Clients** (desirability validation):
- Design and execute ad campaigns for desirability evidence
- Collect customer signals (clicks, conversions, engagement)
- Generate quantitative evidence for pivot/proceed decisions

---

#### Compass's Dual Responsibilities

**For StartupAI** (building our flywheel):
- Synthesize evidence from StartupAI's own test cycles
- Recommend pivots or proceed decisions for StartupAI's product roadmap
- Integrate learnings across client engagements into methodology improvements

**For Clients** (desirability validation):
- Synthesize evidence across test cycles within each gate
- Deliver pivot/proceed recommendations based on evidence analysis
- Ensure learnings from each cycle inform the next iteration

---

#### Guardian's Dual Responsibilities

**For StartupAI** (building our flywheel):
- Govern the validation process integrity (no false positives/negatives)
- Monitor data privacy and compliance across client engagements
- Ensure the flywheel doesn't learn bad patterns from edge cases

**For Clients** (desirability validation):
- Monitor governance risks in value proposition delivery
- Flag compliance constraints that affect testability
- Ensure experiment designs meet ethical standards

---

#### Ledger's Dual Responsibilities

**For StartupAI** (building our flywheel):
- Monitor StartupAI's own viability while we build desirability validation for clients
- Resource allocation across founders based on learning ROI
- Pricing strategy for the 3-cycle offering and platform tiers
- Track unit economics as the flywheel matures

**For Clients** (current phase - desirability focus):
- Consulted on pricing/value capture elements in VPC design
- Monitor cost efficiency of test cycles

**For Clients** (future phase - viability validation):
- Unit economics analysis
- Revenue model design
- Pricing strategy recommendations
- Runway/burn rate projections

---

### PSIU Balance (Organizational Physics)
Following Lex Sisney's framework, the team covers all four organizational styles:

| Style | Function | Founders |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Producer** | Drive results, ship things | Forge, Pulse |
| **Stabilizer** | Systems, consistency, discipline | Guardian, Ledger |
| **Innovator** | Strategy, vision, change | Sage |
| **Unifier** | Integration, synthesis | Compass |

## Customer-Centric Structure

```
                    Sage
                  (Strategy)
                      ↕

   Ledger ←───────────────────────→ Forge
  (Finance)                      (Technology)
      ↕                               ↕

            ┌─────────────┐
            │  CUSTOMER   │
            │  (Center)   │
            └─────────────┘

      ↕                               ↕
  Guardian ←───────────────────────→ Pulse
(Governance)                       (Growth)

                      ↕
                  Compass
                  (Product)
```

**Key principle**: The customer is the integrating point. All founders maintain awareness of the customer's journey and contribute when relevant - not waiting in sequence for their turn.

## Engagement Model

### Traditional Funnel (What We Don't Do)
```
Marketing → Sales → Product → Support → Renewal
```
Linear handoffs create entropy and lose customer context.

### Customer Orbit (What We Do)
All founders engage based on customer needs:

- **Early journey**: Sage leads (strategy, desirability)
- **Building phase**: Forge leads (feasibility, MVP)
- **Validation phase**: Ledger leads (viability), Pulse leads (growth testing)
- **Decision point**: Compass synthesizes all evidence
- **Throughout**: Guardian monitors governance, Ledger monitors costs

### Derisking Sequence
Following lean startup principles:
1. **Desirability** - Do customers want it? (Sage)
2. **Feasibility** - Can we build it? (Forge)
3. **Viability** - Can we make money? (Ledger)

Note: Ledger monitors cost structure throughout, then does deep viability analysis at the right moment.

## Organizational Structure

### Service/Commercial Model

StartupAI operates as two interconnected sides balanced by Compass, with Guardian providing governance oversight.

### Guardian's Dual Role

Guardian serves as both **Founder** and **Board Member**:

**As Founder:**
- Co-equal peer in the founding team
- Has dual responsibilities (For StartupAI / For Clients)
- Contributes to building the company

**As Board Member:**
- Elevated accountability for governance across all functions
- Holds other founders accountable
- Ensures organizational integrity

**Accountability vs Responsibility:**
Guardian is *accountable* for governance outcomes (the buck stops here), while specialist agents and other founders are *responsible* for executing governance work. For example:
- Guardian accountable for legal compliance → Ledger's Legal & Compliance agent responsible for execution
- Guardian accountable for security → Forge's team responsible for secure code
- Guardian accountable for quality → All teams responsible for quality work

### The Client Brief Handoff

The **Client Brief** is the contract between Service and Commercial sides:

**Service Side captures:**
- Business idea/hypothesis
- Target customer description
- Problem being solved
- Current stage (idea/MVP/traction)
- Validation goals
- Segment-specific context (Founder vs Consultant)

**Commercial Side receives:**
- Structured brief that informs all downstream analysis
- Everything needed to begin Customer Research → Competitor Analysis → Value Design → Validation

### Compass as Balancing Force

Compass (CPO) sits at the center, balancing natural tensions:

| Service Side Wants | Commercial Side Wants |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Delight customers | Deliver efficiently |
| Capture full context | Move to execution |
| Accommodate requests | Maintain standards |

**Why Compass:**
- Core competency is synthesizing competing evidence
- Product must balance what's promised (Service) with what's delivered (Commercial)
- Pivot/proceed authority requires seeing both perspectives
- PSIU: Compass is the **Unifier**

## Specialist Agents (Task Executors)

Specialist agents execute specific tasks within each founder's domain. Total: **18 agents** across the organization.

### Service Side Agents (Sage owns)

| Agent | Task Focus |
|-------|------------|
| **Customer Service Agent** | Marketing site conversations, lead qualification, email capture, routing to appropriate onboarding |
| **Founder Onboarding Agent** | Structured interviews for founder segment, business context extraction, brief creation |
| **Consultant Onboarding Agent** | Structured interviews for consultant/agency segment, white-label context, multi-client needs |

### Commercial Side Agents

#### Sage (CSO) - Strategy & Analysis

| Agent | Task Focus |
|-------|------------|
| **Customer Researcher** | Jobs, Pains, Gains analysis using JTBD framework |
| **Competitor Analyst** | Competitive landscape mapping, differentiation opportunities |

#### Forge (CTO) - Build & Deploy

## CrewAI Implementation

This organizational structure is the **conceptual design**. Translation to CrewAI implementation will follow.

**Current CrewAI agents** (`config/agents.yaml`):
- `onboarding_agent`, `customer_researcher`, `competitor_analyst`, `value_designer`, `validation_agent`, `qa_agent`

**Mapping note**: The conceptual specialist agents will be implemented as CrewAI agents over time. Some map directly to existing agents; others represent future capability expansion.

## Naming Conventions

### When to Use Founder Names
- Marketing materials (public-facing)
- User interfaces (explaining what's happening)
- Team introductions

**Example**: "Sage is analyzing your strategic positioning..."

### When to Use Specialist Agent Names
- Technical implementation
- API responses
- Logs and debugging
- Configuration files

**Example**: `"agent": "customer_researcher", "task": "jtbd_analysis"`
