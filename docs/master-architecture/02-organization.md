# StartupAI Organizational Structure

## Overview

StartupAI is run by a team of AI Founders - six co-equal team members organized around the customer. They collaborate as peers to deliver strategic business analysis and validation using the **Value Proposition Design (VPD)** framework by Alex Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur.

**This document is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for founder names, roles, agents, and organizational structure. All other documents reference here - they do not duplicate this content.**

> **VPD Framework Compliance**: This organization implements patterns from *Value Proposition Design*, *Testing Business Ideas*, and *Business Model Generation*. See `05-phase-0-1-specification.md` for detailed Phase 0-1 implementation.

## Design Philosophy

### Startup Reality
Startups are temporary organizations in search of sustainable business models. The flat structure is intentional - it's all hands on deck in the search for customers, the development of products, and the formation of a winning team.

### Customer-Centric Model
Inspired by Edwin Korver's RoundMap® Customer Dynamics Lifecycle, StartupAI places the customer at the center rather than using a traditional linear funnel. All founders orient around the customer's journey and needs, engaging adaptively as required.

### Continuous Learning
AI organizations have a structural advantage over human-led companies: they learn from every interaction. This is StartupAI's moat. Learning isn't delegated to a role - it's inherent to the system.

## VPD Framework Terminology

StartupAI implements the Value Proposition Design (VPD) framework. Key terminology used throughout this organization:

### Value Proposition Canvas (Two Sides)

| Side | Component | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Customer Profile (Right)** | Jobs-to-be-Done | Functional, emotional, social tasks customers try to accomplish |
| | Pains | Undesired outcomes, obstacles, risks customers face |
| | Gains | Required, expected, desired, unexpected outcomes customers seek |
| **Value Map (Left)** | Products & Services | What we offer to help customers |
| | Pain Relievers | How we address specific pains |
| | Gain Creators | How we create specific gains |

### Testing Business Ideas Framework

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Assumptions Mapping** | 2×2 matrix (importance × evidence strength) to prioritize what to test |
| **Test Card** | 4-step hypothesis structure: Hypothesis → Test → Metric → Criteria |
| **Learning Card** | 4-step result capture: Hypothesis → Observation → Learnings → Actions |
| **44 Experiment Library** | Discovery (cheap/fast) → Validation (expensive/reliable) experiments |

### Evidence Hierarchy (SAY vs DO)

Behavioral evidence is stronger than stated preferences:

| Type | Weight | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Paid | 5 | Actually paid money |
| High-Commitment CTA | 4 | Demo request, application |
| Medium-Commitment CTA | 3 | Email signup, form fill |
| Low-Commitment CTA | 2 | Click, view |
| Stated | 1 | "I would buy this" |
| Implied | 0.5 | Didn't say no |

### Problem-Solution Fit Criteria

Phase 1 exit requires:
- **Fit Score** ≥ 70/100
- **Jobs addressed** ≥ 75%
- **Pains addressed** ≥ 75%
- **Gains addressed** ≥ 70%
- **WTP validated** (behavioral evidence, not just stated)

## The AI Founders Team

### Founding Team (Flat Structure)
Six co-equal founders organized around the customer.

| Founder | Title | Responsibility |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Sage** | Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) | Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Design, market analysis, assumption identification |
| **Forge** | Chief Technology Officer (CTO) | MVP code generation, technical architecture, deployment automation |
| **Pulse** | Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) | Ad campaigns, user acquisition, A/B testing, analytics tracking |
| **Compass** | Chief Product Officer (CPO) | Evidence synthesis, pivot vs proceed analysis, recommendations |
| **Guardian** | Chief Governance Officer (CGO) | Governance monitoring, pattern detection, security oversight |
| **Ledger** | Chief Financial Officer (CFO) | Unit economics, revenue model design, pricing strategy, runway projections |

### Founder Dual Responsibilities

Each founder has dual responsibilities: building StartupAI's own validated business model (eating our own dog food) while delivering desirability validation at scale for clients. StartupAI's first product iteration focuses on desirability validation—the first gate all startups must pass.

#### Sage's Dual Responsibilities

**For StartupAI** (building our flywheel):
- Lead VPC design for StartupAI's own value proposition
- Prioritize assumptions to test across customer segments (Founders vs Consultants)
- Define strategic positioning against traditional consulting and DIY tools
- Contribute learnings from client patterns to refine methodology

**For Clients** (desirability validation):
- Guide VPC design linking customer jobs/pains/gains to value map
- Identify and prioritize riskiest assumptions for testing
- Frame strategic context for experiment interpretation

---

#### Forge's Dual Responsibilities

**For StartupAI** (building our flywheel):
- Build and iterate the platform that enables desirability testing at scale
- Technical architecture decisions for the validation engine
- Evaluate build vs buy for expanding capabilities (feasibility, viability tools)

**For Clients** (desirability validation):
- Generate MVPs/prototypes for desirability testing
- Ensure technical pain relievers match customer needs
- Deploy testable artifacts quickly for experiment cycles

---

#### Pulse's Dual Responsibilities

**For StartupAI** (building our flywheel):
- Run desirability experiments for StartupAI itself (user acquisition, messaging tests)
- Collect market signals on StartupAI's value proposition resonance
- Optimize conversion through the 3-cycle funnel (trial → sprint → platform)

**For Clients** (desirability validation):
- Design and execute ad campaigns for desirability evidence
- Collect customer signals (clicks, conversions, engagement)
- Generate quantitative evidence for pivot/proceed decisions

---

#### Compass's Dual Responsibilities

**For StartupAI** (building our flywheel):
- Synthesize evidence from StartupAI's own test cycles
- Recommend pivots or proceed decisions for StartupAI's product roadmap
- Integrate learnings across client engagements into methodology improvements

**For Clients** (desirability validation):
- Synthesize evidence across test cycles within each gate
- Deliver pivot/proceed recommendations based on evidence analysis
- Ensure learnings from each cycle inform the next iteration

---

#### Guardian's Dual Responsibilities

**For StartupAI** (building our flywheel):
- Govern the validation process integrity (no false positives/negatives)
- Monitor data privacy and compliance across client engagements
- Ensure the flywheel doesn't learn bad patterns from edge cases

**For Clients** (desirability validation):
- Monitor governance risks in value proposition delivery
- Flag compliance constraints that affect testability
- Ensure experiment designs meet ethical standards

---

#### Ledger's Dual Responsibilities

**For StartupAI** (building our flywheel):
- Monitor StartupAI's own viability while we build desirability validation for clients
- Resource allocation across founders based on learning ROI
- Pricing strategy for the 3-cycle offering and platform tiers
- Track unit economics as the flywheel matures

**For Clients** (current phase - desirability focus):
- Consulted on pricing/value capture elements in VPC design
- Monitor cost efficiency of test cycles

**For Clients** (future phase - viability validation):
- Unit economics analysis
- Revenue model design
- Pricing strategy recommendations
- Runway/burn rate projections

---

### PSIU Balance (Organizational Physics)
Following Lex Sisney's framework, the team covers all four organizational styles:

| Style | Function | Founders |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Producer** | Drive results, ship things | Forge, Pulse |
| **Stabilizer** | Systems, consistency, discipline | Guardian, Ledger |
| **Innovator** | Strategy, vision, change | Sage |
| **Unifier** | Integration, synthesis | Compass |

## Customer-Centric Structure

```
                    Sage
                  (Strategy)
                      ↕

   Ledger ←───────────────────────→ Forge
  (Finance)                      (Technology)
      ↕                               ↕

            ┌─────────────┐
            │  CUSTOMER   │
            │  (Center)   │
            └─────────────┘

  Guardian ←───────────────────────→ Pulse

                      ↕
                  Compass
                  (Product)
```

**Key principle**: The customer is the integrating point. All founders maintain awareness of the customer's journey and contribute when relevant - not waiting in sequence for their turn.

## Engagement Model

### Traditional Funnel (What We Don't Do)
```
Marketing → Sales → Product → Support → Renewal
```
Linear handoffs create entropy and lose customer context.

### Customer Orbit (What We Do)
All founders engage based on customer needs:

- **Early journey**: Sage leads (strategy, desirability)
- **Building phase**: Forge leads (feasibility, MVP)
- **Validation phase**: Ledger leads (viability), Pulse leads (growth testing)
- **Decision point**: Compass synthesizes all evidence
- **Throughout**: Guardian monitors governance, Ledger monitors costs

### Derisking Sequence
Following lean startup principles:
1. **Desirability** - Do customers want it? (Sage)
2. **Feasibility** - Can we build it? (Forge)
3. **Viability** - Can we make money? (Ledger)

Note: Ledger monitors cost structure throughout, then does deep viability analysis at the right moment.

## Organizational Structure

### Service/Commercial Model

StartupAI operates as two interconnected sides balanced by Compass, with Guardian providing governance oversight.

### Guardian's Board-Level Role

Guardian is fundamentally different from the other five founders. While Sage, Forge, Pulse, Compass, and Ledger are **Executives** who build and deliver, Guardian is a **Board Member** who oversees and validates.

#### Board vs Executive Distinction

| Dimension | Executives (Sage, Forge, Pulse, Compass, Ledger) | Board (Guardian) |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Primary Verb** | Builds, executes, delivers | Oversees, validates, challenges |
| **Core Question** | "How do we do this?" | "Should we do this? Is it done right?" |
| **Authority Type** | Responsible for outcomes | Accountable for governance integrity |
| **Involvement** | Hands-on, in the work | Hands-off, above the work |
| **Analogy** | CEO, CFO, CTO, CMO, CPO | Board Chair / Non-Executive Director |
| **Decision Mode** | Makes execution decisions | Reviews, consults, can veto |

#### What Guardian Does NOT Do

Guardian is a **sentinel**, not an executor. Guardian does NOT:
- Build products or features (Forge does)
- Run marketing campaigns (Pulse does)
- Design strategy (Sage does)
- Synthesize evidence for decisions (Compass does)
- Calculate unit economics (Ledger does)
- Own business outcomes

Guardian DOES:
- Ask hard questions others might avoid
- Review decisions for compliance, ethics, and risk
- Validate methodology adherence
- Ensure audit trails exist
- Flag issues and escalate concerns
- Veto decisions that violate governance standards

#### Guardian as Sentinel (Overwatch Model)

              └─────────┘   └─────────┘   └─────────┘
```

Guardian's agents **review** and **validate**—they don't **create** or **execute**.

#### Data Governance: Distributed Ownership

Guardian encompasses Chief Governance Officer responsibilities including data governance oversight. However, data-related questions are **owned by domain experts**, with Guardian providing **oversight review**:

| Data Question | Owner | Guardian's Oversight |
|---------------|-------|---------------------|
| Strategic alignment | **Sage** (CSO) | Reviews goal clarity |
| Business objectives | **Sage** + **Compass** | Reviews measurability |
| KPIs & success measures | **Compass** + **Ledger** | Reviews metrics validity |
| Data ownership | **Compass** (CPO) | Reviews accountability |
| Data customers/users | **Sage** (CSO) | Reviews customer focus |
| Required data sources | **Forge** + **Pulse** | Reviews data minimization |
| Data governance & privacy | **Guardian** (direct) | Owns this domain |
| Analytics approach | **Pulse** + **Ledger** | Reviews methodology |
| Technology requirements | **Forge** (CTO) | Reviews security posture |
| Skills & capacity | **Compass** + **Ledger** | Reviews resourcing |
| Change management | **Compass** (CPO) | Reviews risk mitigation |

**Key insight**: Guardian owns **data governance** (privacy, access, security, retention) but NOT data strategy, data collection, or data analysis—those belong to the executive founders.

#### RACI Model for Approvals

Guardian is **always Consulted, never Accountable** for execution decisions. Guardian's accountability is for **governance integrity**, not business outcomes.

| Gate | Accountable (A) | Responsible (R) | Guardian Role |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| `approve_founders_brief` | Sage | S1 | **Consulted** (legitimacy) |
| `approve_experiment_plan` | Sage | E1 | **Consulted** (methodology) |
| `approve_pricing_test` | Ledger | W1, W2 | **Consulted** (compliance) |
| `approve_vpc_completion` | Compass | F1, F2 | **Consulted** (quality) |
| `approve_campaign_launch` | Pulse | P1, P3 | **Consulted** (brand safety) |
| `approve_desirability_gate` | Compass | Evidence synthesis | **Consulted** (methodology) |
| `approve_feasibility_gate` | Forge | F3 | **Consulted** (security) |
| `approve_viability_gate` | Ledger | L1, L3 | **Consulted** (compliance) |
| `request_human_decision` | Compass | C1, C2 | **Consulted** (audit trail) |

**Veto Authority**: While Guardian is "Consulted" not "Accountable," Guardian retains **veto authority** on governance grounds. If a decision violates compliance, ethics, or security standards, Guardian can block progression until issues are resolved.

### Approval Checkpoint Ownership

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) approvals are distributed across founders based on domain expertise and phase. Each approval type has a primary owner who prepares the approval request and a governance reviewer.

#### Phase 0 Approvals (Onboarding)

| Approval Type | Primary Owner | Prepares Request | Governance Review |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Founder's Brief** (`approve_founders_brief`) | Sage + Founder | Brief content, hypothesis capture | Guardian (G1, G2) |
| **Concept Legitimacy** | Guardian (G1) | Legal, ethical, feasibility screening | Sage |
| **Intent Verification** | Guardian (G2) | Brief accuracy vs founder intent | Sage |

#### Phase 1 Approvals (VPC Discovery)

| Approval Type | Primary Owner | Prepares Request | Governance Review |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Experiment Plan** (`approve_experiment_plan`) | Sage (E1) | Experiment mix, cost, timeline | Guardian |
| **Pricing Tests** (`approve_pricing_test`) | Ledger (W1, W2) | Price points, payment methods | Guardian |
| **VPC Completion** (`approve_vpc_completion`) | Compass (F1) | Fit score, evidence summary | Guardian |

#### Phase 2+ Approvals (Validation)

| Approval Type | Primary Owner | Prepares Request | Governance Review |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Spend Increases** | Ledger (CFO) | Cost analysis, ROI projection, alternatives | Guardian |
| **Campaign Launch** | Pulse (CMO) | Creative, copy, targeting, landing pages | Guardian |
| **Direct Customer Contact** | Pulse (CMO) | Messaging, target list, outreach plan | Guardian |
| **Stage Gate Progression** | Guardian (CGO) | QA report, evidence synthesis, gate criteria | Compass (synthesis) |
| **Pivot Recommendations** | Compass (CPO) | Evidence synthesis, pivot rationale, direction | Guardian |
| **Third-Party Data Sharing** | Guardian (CGO) | Data inventory, recipient, purpose, retention | Ledger (compliance) |

**Workflow Pattern:**
1. Primary owner's crew generates proposal with supporting evidence
2. Task with `human_input: true` pauses workflow
3. Webhook notifies product app → approval modal appears
4. Human reviews, approves/rejects/modifies
5. Product app calls `/resume` endpoint
6. Flow continues based on decision

**Guardian's Approval Orchestration Role:**
Guardian serves as the approval orchestrator, ensuring:
- All approval requests meet quality standards before reaching users
- Approval audit trail is maintained
- Escalations are handled appropriately
- Compliance requirements are satisfied

### The Founder's Brief Handoff

The **Founder's Brief** is the contract between Phase 0 (Onboarding) and Phase 1+ (Validation):

**Phase 0 (Onboarding) captures:**
- The Idea (concept, one-liner hypothesis)
- Problem Hypothesis (who, what, alternatives)
- Customer Hypothesis (segment, characteristics)
- Solution Hypothesis (approach, key features)
- Key Assumptions (ranked by risk)
- Success Criteria (what "validated" means)
- Founder Context (stage, resources, constraints)

**Phase 1+ (Validation) receives:**
- Structured Founder's Brief that informs all downstream analysis
- Everything needed to begin VPC Discovery → Desirability → Feasibility → Viability

> **VPD Note**: The Founder's Brief captures *hypotheses* about customer and value. Phase 1 VPC Discovery validates these against customer reality using experiments from the Testing Business Ideas framework.

### Compass as Balancing Force

Compass (CPO) sits at the center, balancing natural tensions:

| Service Side Wants | Commercial Side Wants |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Delight customers | Deliver efficiently |
| Capture full context | Move to execution |
| Accommodate requests | Maintain standards |

**Why Compass:**
- Core competency is synthesizing competing evidence
- Product must balance what's promised (Service) with what's delivered (Commercial)
- Pivot/proceed authority requires seeing both perspectives
- PSIU: Compass is the **Unifier**

## Specialist Agents (Task Executors)

Specialist agents execute specific tasks within each founder's domain. Agents are organized by phase:

- **Phase 0 (Onboarding)**: 4 agents - Founder's Brief creation
- **Phase 1+ (Validation)**: 18+ agents - VPC Discovery through Decision

### Phase 0: Onboarding Agents

Phase 0 agents capture the founder's business hypothesis and create the **Founder's Brief** - the prime input to all downstream validation. See `05-phase-0-1-specification.md` for full specification.

| ID | Agent | Founder | Task Focus |
|----|-------|---------|------------|
| **O1** | Founder Interview Agent | Sage | 7-area discovery interview (idea, motivation, customer, problem, solution, assumptions, success criteria) |
| **G1** | Concept Validator Agent | Guardian | Legitimacy screening (legal, ethical, feasible, sane) |
| **G2** | Intent Verification Agent | Guardian | Ensures Founder's Brief accurately captures founder's intent |
| **S1** | Brief Compiler Agent | Sage | Synthesizes interview and QA outputs into structured Founder's Brief |

**Phase 0 HITL Checkpoint**: `approve_founders_brief` - Founder reviews and approves their brief before Phase 1 begins.

### Phase 1: VPC Discovery Agents

Phase 1 agents discover customer reality (Customer Profile) and design value (Value Map) using the VPD framework. See `05-phase-0-1-specification.md` for full specification.

| **V2** | Pain Reliever Designer | Forge | Design pain relievers for top pains |
| **V3** | Gain Creator Designer | Forge | Design gain creators for top gains |
| **W1** | Pricing Experiment Agent | Ledger | Design WTP experiments (Van Westendorp, pricing A/B, conjoint) |
| **W2** | Payment Test Agent | Ledger | Run payment tests (pre-orders, crowdfunding, LOIs) |
| **F1** | Fit Analyst | Compass | Score Problem-Solution Fit (Customer Profile ↔ Value Map coverage) |
| **F2** | Iteration Router | Compass | Route back to appropriate flow if fit < 70 |

**Phase 1 HITL Checkpoints**:
- `approve_experiment_plan` - Approve experiment mix before execution
- `approve_pricing_test` - Approve tests involving real money
- `approve_vpc_completion` - Confirm VPC ready for Phase 2 (fit ≥ 70)

### Governance Agents (Guardian)

| Agent | Task Focus |
|-------|------------|
| **Audit Agent** | Process audits, compliance verification, accountability tracking |
| **Security Agent** | Data privacy, security monitoring, threat assessment |
| **Quality Assurance Agent** | Framework compliance, logical consistency, output quality |

## CrewAI Implementation

This organizational structure is the **conceptual design**. Translation to CrewAI implementation will follow.

**Current CrewAI agents** (`config/agents.yaml`):
- `onboarding_agent`, `customer_researcher`, `competitor_analyst`, `value_designer`, `validation_agent`, `qa_agent`

**Mapping note**: The conceptual specialist agents will be implemented as CrewAI agents over time. Some map directly to existing agents; others represent future capability expansion.

## Naming Conventions

### When to Use Founder Names
- Marketing materials (public-facing)
- User interfaces (explaining what's happening)
- Team introductions

**Example**: "Sage is analyzing your strategic positioning..."

### When to Use Specialist Agent Names
- Technical implementation
- API responses
- Logs and debugging
- Configuration files

**Example**: `"agent": "customer_researcher", "task": "jtbd_analysis"`
