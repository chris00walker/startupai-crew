    As Compass (CPO), synthesize all validation evidence to determine the strategic path forward.

    INNOVATION PHYSICS DECISION LOGIC:

    Phase 1 - Desirability Signals:
    - If problem_resonance < 30%: Recommend SEGMENT_PIVOT
      Reasoning: "Customer segment shows no interest in the problem itself"

    - If problem_resonance > 50% BUT zombie_ratio < 0.1: Recommend VALUE_PIVOT
      Reasoning: "High traffic but no commitment - value proposition isn't compelling enough"

    - If commitment_type == "verbal" only: Recommend VALUE_PIVOT
      Reasoning: "Only verbal interest without skin-in-game indicates zombie features"

    Phase 2 - Feasibility Signals:
    - If core_features marked "impossible": Recommend FEATURE_PIVOT
      Reasoning: "Must downgrade promise to match technical reality"

    - If feasibility_status == "constrained": Evaluate degradation impact
      If degradation reduces value > 40%: Recommend MODEL_PIVOT

    Phase 3 - Viability Signals:
    - If LTV/CAC < 1: Analyze root cause
      - If CAC too high: Recommend CHANNEL_PIVOT (find cheaper acquisition)
      - If LTV too low: Evaluate pricing elasticity
        - If price-sensitive: Recommend SEGMENT_PIVOT (find less price-sensitive segment)
        - If value insufficient: Recommend VALUE_PIVOT (increase value delivery)

    - If LTV/CAC between 1-3: Recommend optimization within current model

    Kill Criteria (Recommend KILL):
    - After 3+ pivots with no improvement
    - TAM * achievable_share * margin < minimum_viable_business
    - No segment shows problem_resonance > 30%
    - Core value technically impossible with no acceptable downgrade

    Analyze the provided evidence and output:
    1. Evidence strength assessment (strong/weak/none)
    2. Key insights from each validation phase
    3. Specific pivot_recommendation based on the logic above
    4. Detailed reasoning for the recommendation
    5. Success criteria for the recommended path

    A comprehensive synthesis report containing:
    - pivot_recommendation: One of [SEGMENT_PIVOT, VALUE_PIVOT, CHANNEL_PIVOT, MODEL_PIVOT, FEATURE_PIVOT, NO_PIVOT, KILL]
    - evidence_summary: Structured summary of all validation evidence
    - recommendation: Clear strategic recommendation with rationale
    - specific_changes: List of specific changes required
    - success_criteria: Measurable criteria for the new direction
    - confidence_score: 0-1 confidence in the recommendation

strategic_pivot:
  description: |
    Unit Economics Crisis - Design strategic pivot when CAC > LTV.

    You have two primary paths to evaluate:

    PATH 1 - INCREASE PRICE:
    - Calculate required price increase to achieve LTV/CAC > 3
    - Assess pricing elasticity from desirability evidence
    - Determine if segment can bear higher price
    - If not, identify higher-value segment

    PATH 2 - REDUCE COST:
    - Identify features driving high CAC or operational cost
    - Determine which features are non-critical
    - Calculate cost reduction from feature removal
    - Verify reduced offering maintains desirability

    Decision Framework:
    1. If customers show high commitment (skin_in_game): Try INCREASE PRICE first
    2. If product complexity drives cost: Try REDUCE COST first
    3. If neither works: Recommend MODEL_PIVOT or SEGMENT_PIVOT

    Provide specific recommendation with:
    - Chosen path (increase_price or reduce_cost)
    - Specific changes required
    - Expected impact on unit economics
    - Risk assessment
    - Testing approach for validation

  expected_output: |
    Strategic pivot decision containing:
    - pivot_type: "increase_price" or "reduce_cost" or alternative
    - specific_changes: Detailed list of changes
    - expected_ltv_cac: Projected ratio after changes
    - implementation_steps: Ordered steps to execute
    - risks: Key risks and mitigation strategies
    - validation_tests: How to test the pivot hypothesis

final_synthesis:
  description: |
    Comprehensive final synthesis when standard validation paths have failed or complex decisions needed.

    Review the entire validation journey:
    1. Original hypothesis and assumptions
    2. Evidence collected at each phase
    3. Pivots attempted and their outcomes
    4. Current blockers and constraints

    Apply the Innovation Physics framework:
    - Desirability without Feasibility = Beautiful fiction
    - Feasibility without Desirability = Solution looking for problem
    - Viability without both = Unsustainable charity

    Determine if the project should:
    - Continue with specific pivot (specify exact type)
    - Pause for major strategic rethink
    - Terminate due to fundamental invalidation

    If recommending continuation, provide:
    - Clear pivot_recommendation from enum
    - Hypothesis for why this pivot will work
    - Evidence supporting the hypothesis
    - Minimum viable test to validate

    If recommending termination:
    - Clear rationale why no viable path exists
    - Key learnings for future ventures
    - Adjacent opportunities discovered

  expected_output: |
    Final synthesis report with:
    - recommendation: Clear proceed/pivot/kill decision
    - pivot_recommendation: Specific enum value
    - evidence_summary: Comprehensive evidence review
    - next_steps: Concrete action items
    - learnings: Key insights for methodology improvement
    - confidence: Confidence level in recommendation

experiment_design:
  description: |
    Design validation experiments based on prioritized assumptions.

    For each critical assumption (priority 1-3):
    1. Select appropriate experiment type from Testing Business Ideas library
    2. Define clear success/failure criteria
    3. Determine minimum viable sample size
    4. Design to maximize learning while minimizing cost

    Experiment types by commitment level:
    - Low: Problem interviews, surveys (evidence_strength: weak)
    - Medium: Landing pages, fake doors (evidence_strength: medium)
    - High: Concierge MVP, LOIs, pre-orders (evidence_strength: strong)

    Each experiment must test for:
    - Problem severity (is it a top-3 problem?)
    - Solution preference (better than alternatives?)
    - Commitment depth (will they pay/invest time?)

    Output structured experiment plans with:
    - Hypothesis to test
    - Experiment methodology
    - Success metrics and thresholds
    - Timeline and budget
    - Risk mitigation

  expected_output: |
    Experiment design document with:
    - experiments: List of structured experiment plans
    - priority_order: Sequence of execution
    - resource_requirements: Time, money, people needed
    - expected_learnings: What each experiment will teach us
    - decision_tree: How results determine next steps
