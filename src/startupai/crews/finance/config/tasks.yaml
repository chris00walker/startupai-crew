    Calculate unit economics and assess business viability:

    Value Maps: {value_maps}
    Desirability Evidence: {desirability_evidence}
    Feasibility Evidence: {feasibility_evidence}
    Market Size: {market_size}

    Calculate:
    1. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
       - Marketing costs per channel
       - Sales costs if applicable
       - Conversion funnel analysis
    2. Lifetime Value (LTV)
       - Revenue per customer
       - Retention/churn rate
       - Expansion revenue potential
    3. LTV/CAC Ratio
       - Target: >3x for healthy business
    4. Payback Period
       - Months to recover CAC
    5. Gross Margin
       - Revenue minus direct costs
  expected_output: >
    Viability evidence containing:
    - cac: float (customer acquisition cost)
    - ltv: float (lifetime value)
    - ltv_cac_ratio: float
    - payback_months: int
    - gross_margin: float (percentage)
    - break_even_customers: int

optimize_economics:
  description: >
    Identify optimizations to improve marginal unit economics:

    Current CAC: {current_cac}
    Current LTV: {current_ltv}
    Current Margin: {current_margin}

    Analyze opportunities to:
    1. Reduce CAC
       - Channel optimization
       - Conversion improvements
       - Viral/referral mechanisms
    2. Increase LTV
       - Pricing optimization
       - Retention improvements
       - Upsell/cross-sell
    3. Improve margins
       - Cost reduction
       - Automation opportunities

    Prioritize by impact and effort.

    Optimized metrics containing:
    - optimized_metrics: updated viability evidence
    - optimizations_applied: list of changes
    - expected_improvement: percentage gain in LTV/CAC
    - implementation_effort: High/Medium/Low
  agent: unit_economics_analyst

build_financial_model:
  description: >
    Create a financial projection model for the business:

    Viability Evidence: {viability_evidence}
    Market Size: {market_size}
    Growth Assumptions: {growth_assumptions}

    Build a 3-year projection showing:
    1. Revenue growth trajectory
    2. Cost structure evolution
    3. Path to profitability
    4. Funding requirements
    5. Key milestones and metrics
  expected_output: >
    Financial model containing:
    - monthly_projections: first 12 months detailed
    - annual_projections: years 1-3
    - key_milestones: revenue and profitability targets
    - funding_needs: amount and timing
    - sensitivity_analysis: key variable impacts

prepare_viability_decision:
  description: >
    Prepare unit economics analysis for human strategic decision:

    CAC: {cac}
    LTV: {ltv}
    Gross Margin: {gross_margin}
    TAM: {tam}
    Business Context: {business_context}

    Using the viability_approval tool, analyze the unit economics and:
    1. Determine viability status (profitable, marginal, underwater, zombie)
    2. Identify all critical and warning issues
    3. Generate pivot recommendations if needed
    4. Calculate confidence score based on data quality
    5. Prepare summary for human dashboard display

    The output will be shown to the user to help them decide:
    - Price pivot: Increase pricing to improve LTV
    - Cost pivot: Reduce CAC through feature/channel cuts
    - Continue: Proceed despite marginal economics
    - Kill: Terminate the validation

  expected_output: >
    Viability decision package containing:
    - status: profitable/marginal/underwater/zombie
    - needs_decision: boolean
    - metrics: {cac, ltv, ltv_cac_ratio, gross_margin, tam}
    - issues: list of {severity, metric, message}
    - pivot_options: list of {type, description, impact, confidence}
    - recommended_pivot: price_pivot/cost_pivot/segment_pivot/kill or null
    - summary: human-readable assessment
