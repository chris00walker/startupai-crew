    Calculate unit economics and assess business viability:

    Value Maps: {value_maps}
    Desirability Evidence: {desirability_evidence}
    Feasibility Evidence: {feasibility_evidence}
    Market Size: {market_size}

    Calculate:
    1. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
       - Marketing costs per channel
       - Sales costs if applicable
       - Conversion funnel analysis
    2. Lifetime Value (LTV)
       - Revenue per customer
       - Retention/churn rate
       - Expansion revenue potential
    3. LTV/CAC Ratio
       - Target: >3x for healthy business
    4. Payback Period
       - Months to recover CAC
    5. Gross Margin
       - Revenue minus direct costs
  expected_output: >
    Viability evidence containing:
    - cac: float (customer acquisition cost)
    - ltv: float (lifetime value)
    - ltv_cac_ratio: float
    - payback_months: int
    - gross_margin: float (percentage)
    - break_even_customers: int
    - market_size_addressable: float

optimize_economics:
  description: >
    Identify optimizations to improve marginal unit economics:

    Current CAC: {current_cac}
    Current LTV: {current_ltv}
    Current Margin: {current_margin}

    Analyze opportunities to:
    1. Reduce CAC
       - Channel optimization
       - Conversion improvements
       - Viral/referral mechanisms
    2. Increase LTV
       - Pricing optimization
       - Retention improvements
       - Upsell/cross-sell
    3. Improve margins
       - Cost reduction
       - Automation opportunities

    Prioritize by impact and effort.
