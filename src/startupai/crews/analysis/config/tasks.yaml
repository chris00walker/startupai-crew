analyze_customer_segment:
  description: >
    Perform deep analysis of the target customer segment using Jobs-to-be-Done
    framework:

    Segment: {segment}
    Business Idea: {business_idea}
    Initial Assumptions: {assumptions}

    Create a comprehensive customer profile:
    1. Customer Jobs
       - Functional jobs (tasks to complete)
       - Social jobs (how they want to be perceived)
       - Emotional jobs (feelings they seek)
    2. Customer Pains
       - Undesired outcomes and obstacles
       - Risks and negative consequences
    3. Customer Gains
       - Required outcomes and expectations
       - Desired outcomes and aspirations
       - Unexpected delights

    Also create the Value Map showing how the solution addresses these.
  expected_output: >
    A structured analysis containing:
    - customer_profile: {jobs: [], pains: [], gains: []}
    - value_map: {pain_relievers: [], gain_creators: [], products_services: []}
    - fit_score: float between 0-1 indicating problem-solution fit
    - key_insights: list of critical findings

analyze_competitors:
  description: >
    Map the competitive landscape for the business idea:

    Business Idea: {business_idea}
    Target Segments: {segments}

    Analyze:
    1. Direct Competitors - Same solution, same customer
    2. Indirect Competitors - Different solution, same job-to-be-done
    3. Substitutes - What customers do today without this solution
    4. Positioning Map - 2x2 matrix of key differentiators

    For each competitor, evaluate:
    - Value proposition strength
    - Market share/traction
    - Pricing model
    - Key weaknesses
  expected_output: >
    A competitive analysis report containing:
    - direct_competitors: list of {name, description, strengths, weaknesses}
    - indirect_competitors: list
    - substitutes: list
    - positioning_map: {x_axis, y_axis, positions}
    - market_gaps: identified opportunities
    - competitive_threats: key risks

iterate_value_proposition:
  description: >
    Based on evidence showing high interest but low commitment (zombie signal),
    redesign the value proposition:

    Current Value Map: {current_value_map}
    Customer Profile: {customer_profile}
    Evidence: {evidence}
    Zombie Ratio: {zombie_ratio}

    The audience is right, but the promise is wrong. Analyze:
    1. Which pain relievers are not resonating
    2. Which gain creators are missing impact
    3. How to intensify the value proposition

    Redesign the value map to create stronger commitment signals.
  expected_output: >
    An updated value map with:
    - new_value_map: redesigned {pain_relievers, gain_creators, products_services}
    - changes_made: list of specific modifications
    - expected_impact: predicted improvement in commitment
    - testing_approach: how to validate the new proposition
