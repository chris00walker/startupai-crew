test_desirability:
  description: >
    Design and conceptualize experiments to test desirability assumptions:

    Customer Profiles: {customer_profiles}
    Value Maps: {value_maps}
    Critical Assumptions: {assumptions}
    Competitor Analysis: {competitor_analysis}

    For each critical desirability assumption, design an experiment that:
    1. Tests behavioral commitment (not just verbal interest)
    2. Can run quickly (days, not weeks)
    3. Provides clear pass/fail criteria
    4. Measures both traffic and conversion

    Focus on experiments that detect:
    - Problem resonance (do they care about the problem?)
    - Solution fit (does our approach resonate?)
    - Commitment depth (will they put skin in the game?)
  expected_output: >
    Desirability evidence containing:
    - experiments: list of {name, hypothesis, method, success_criteria, results}
    - problem_resonance: float 0-1
    - conversion_rate: float 0-1
    - traffic_quality: High/Medium/Low
    - commitment_depth: SKIN_IN_GAME/VERBAL/NONE
    - key_learnings: list of insights

test_pricing:
  description: >
    Test willingness to pay at a higher price point:

    Current Price: {current_price}
    New Price Multiplier: {new_price_multiplier}
    Customer Profiles: {customer_profiles}
    Value Maps: {value_maps}

    Design experiments to test:
    1. Price sensitivity at new level
    2. Which segments accept higher price
    3. What additional value might justify increase
    4. Comparison with competitor pricing
  expected_output: >
    Pricing test results containing:
    - acceptance_rate: float 0-1 (percentage accepting new price)
    - segment_breakdown: acceptance by segment
    - objections: common reasons for rejection
    - value_gaps: what would justify the price
    - recommendations: pricing strategy suggestions

test_degraded:
  description: >
    Test whether customers accept a degraded version of the product:

    Original Value Maps: {original_value_maps}
    Degradation Impact: {degradation_impact}
    Customer Profiles: {customer_profiles}

    Assess:
    1. Which features customers consider essential
    2. Acceptance of degraded alternative
    3. Impact on willingness to pay
    4. Comparison with competitive alternatives
  expected_output: >
    Degradation acceptance test results:
    - acceptance_rate: float 0-1
    - essential_features: what must stay
    - acceptable_tradeoffs: what can be cut
    - price_impact: effect on willingness to pay
    - competitive_position: how we compare with less features
  agent: signal_analyst

refine_experiments:
  description: >
    Refine and improve experiments based on weak initial results:

    Previous Evidence: {previous_evidence}
    Customer Profiles: {customer_profiles}
    Value Maps: {value_maps}

    Analyze what went wrong and design improved experiments:
    1. Better targeting of customer segment
    2. Clearer value proposition messaging
    3. Stronger calls to action
    4. Better success metrics
  expected_output: >
    Refined desirability evidence with improved experimental design
    and updated results
