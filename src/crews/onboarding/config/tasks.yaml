# OnboardingCrew Task Definitions
# Phase 0: Transform Founder's raw idea into structured Founder's Brief

conduct_founder_interview:
  description: >
    Conduct a comprehensive conversational interview with the founder to understand
    their business idea. Cover all 7 key areas:

    1. THE IDEA: Ask them to describe their idea in their own words. Get the
       one-sentence version they'd tell their grandmother.

    2. THE MOTIVATION: Understand what made them want to build this. Is it a
       problem they've personally experienced? Why them, why now?

    3. CUSTOMER HYPOTHESIS: Who do they imagine using this? Can they describe
       their ideal first customer? Where would they find these people?

    4. PROBLEM HYPOTHESIS: What problem are they solving? How are customers
       solving this today? What's painful about current alternatives?

    5. SOLUTION HYPOTHESIS: How does their solution work? What's different about
       their approach? What are the 2-3 key features that matter most?

    6. KEY ASSUMPTIONS: What has to be true for this to work? What's the riskiest
       assumption they're making? What would make them abandon this idea?

    7. SUCCESS CRITERIA: What would make this worth pursuing? What metrics would
       indicate they're on the right track? What's "good enough" to keep going?

    Founder's input to analyze:
    {entrepreneur_input}
  expected_output: >
    A structured interview summary containing:
    - Raw interview notes organized by the 7 areas
    - Key quotes from the founder (verbatim)
    - Identified gaps or areas needing clarification
    - Initial hypothesis statements extracted from responses
    - Confidence level in each area (high/medium/low)
  agent: o1_founder_interview

  context:

verify_intent_capture:
  description: >
    Compare the interview output with the founder's original input to verify
    that their intent was captured correctly. Check for:

    COMPLETENESS:
    - Were all 7 interview areas covered?
    - Is the customer hypothesis captured?
    - Is the problem hypothesis captured?
    - Is the solution hypothesis captured?
    - Are key assumptions identified?
    - Are success criteria defined?

    ACCURACY:
    - Does the summary reflect what was said?
    - Are there words put in the founder's mouth?
    - Are nuances preserved?
    - Is the enthusiasm level captured?

    CLARITY:
    - Are ambiguous terms clarified?
    - Is industry jargon explained?
    - Is the scope clearly bounded?
    - Is the target market defined?

    CONSISTENCY:
    - Do customer and problem align?
    - Does the solution address the stated problem?
    - Are success criteria measurable?
    - Are assumptions testable?

    Review the interview output from the previous task (conduct_founder_interview)
    and compare it against the founder's original input to verify accuracy.
