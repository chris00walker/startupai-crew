discover_jobs:
  description: >
    Discover all customer jobs using JTBD methodology. Analyze the Founder's
    Brief and discovery results to identify what customers are trying to accomplish.

    ==========================================================================
    FOUNDER'S BRIEF (your source of truth):
    ==========================================================================
    {founders_brief}

    ==========================================================================
    DISCOVERY RESULTS (evidence from DiscoveryCrew):
    ==========================================================================
    {discovery_results}

    ==========================================================================
    YOUR TASK: Discover customer jobs based on the above inputs.
    ==========================================================================

    Discover:
    1. FUNCTIONAL JOBS - Tasks they're trying to complete
    2. EMOTIONAL JOBS - How they want to feel
    3. SOCIAL JOBS - How they want to be perceived
    4. SUPPORTING JOBS - Buyer, co-creator, transferrer roles

    For each job, capture:
    - Job statement ("When [situation], I want to [motivation] so I can [outcome]")
    - Job type (functional/emotional/social/supporting)
    - Evidence sources
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive list of customer jobs with:
    - Job ID
    - Job statement in proper format
    - Job type classification
    - Evidence sources supporting this job
    - Initial importance estimate
  agent: j1_jtbd_researcher

rank_jobs:
  description: >
    Rank the discovered jobs by importance using evidence-based criteria.
    Use the jobs discovered in the previous task (provided in context).

    Ranking criteria (1-10 scale):
    - Frequency: How often does this job come up?
    - Significance: How important is it when it comes up?
    - Urgency: How pressing is the need?
    - Willingness to pay: Would they pay to solve this?
    - Competitive gap: How poorly served is this job?

    Calculate weighted importance score and assign priority rank.
  expected_output: >
    Ranked list of jobs with:
    - Priority rank (1 = most important)
    - Importance score (1-10)
    - Breakdown by ranking criteria
    - Top 5 jobs that MUST be addressed
  agent: j2_job_ranking
  context:
    - discover_jobs

discover_pains:
  description: >
    Discover all customer pains from the Founder's Brief and discovery
    results. Use the ranked jobs from context to identify related pains.

    Discover pains in three categories:
    1. UNDESIRED OUTCOMES
       - Functional outcomes they want to avoid
       - Negative emotions they experience
       - Social consequences they fear

    2. OBSTACLES
       - What prevents them from getting jobs done
       - What makes current solutions hard to use
       - What slows them down

    3. RISKS
       - What could go wrong
       - What they're afraid of
       - What keeps them up at night
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive list of customer pains with:
    - Pain ID
    - Pain statement
    - Category (undesired_outcome/obstacle/risk)
    - Related job(s)
    - Evidence sources
    - Initial severity estimate
  agent: pain_researcher
  context:
    - rank_jobs

rank_pains:
  description: >
    Rank the discovered pains by severity. Use the pains from context.

    Severity scoring:
    - EXTREME (10): Showstopper - they'll do anything to avoid
    - HIGH (7-9): Major frustration - actively seeking solutions
    - MODERATE (4-6): Annoying but tolerable
    - LOW (1-3): Mild inconvenience

    Consider:
    - How much does this pain cost them (time, money, reputation)?
    - How frequently do they experience it?
    - How much effort are they putting into avoiding it?
  expected_output: >
    Ranked list of pains with:
    - Severity rank (1 = most severe)
    - Severity score (1-10)
    - Severity classification (EXTREME/HIGH/MODERATE/LOW)
    - Top 5 pains that MUST be relieved

discover_gains:
  description: >
    Discover all customer gains from the Founder's Brief and discovery
    results. Use the ranked jobs from context to identify related gains.

    Discover gains in four categories:
    1. REQUIRED (Must-have)
       - Minimum outcomes any solution must produce
       - Table-stakes features

    2. EXPECTED (Standard)
       - Outcomes they expect from any solution
       - Considered normal/baseline

    3. DESIRED (Nice-to-have)
       - What would delight them
       - What would exceed expectations

    4. UNEXPECTED (Delighters)
       - Beyond their imagination
       - Innovation opportunities
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive list of customer gains with:
    - Gain ID
    - Gain statement
    - Category (required/expected/desired/unexpected)
    - Related job(s)
    - Evidence sources
    - Initial importance estimate
  agent: gain_researcher
  context:
    - rank_jobs

rank_gains:
  description: >
    Rank the discovered gains by importance. Use the gains from context.

    Importance hierarchy:
    - REQUIRED gains must be created (table stakes)
    - EXPECTED gains should be created (baseline)
    - DESIRED gains could be created (differentiation)
    - UNEXPECTED gains might be created (delight)

    Within each category, rank by customer value.
